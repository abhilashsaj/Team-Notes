# Presence Service

## Task

Build a Presence service, similar to that of google docs, which shows people that are
currently viewing a particular doc.


## Requirements

This application can be built on any framework which you are comfortable with and feel is best
suited for this.

  1. You would need to create both backend & frontend for this application.
  2. Create a basic user registration and authentication system.
  3. Create a page that contains the UI element/component (similar to the one shown
  towards the left in the image above) to show the people who are currently viewing the
  page. This page should only be accessed by registered users.
  4. UI element/component should have the following features
      1. We should be able to see their registered name, avatar, etc on hovering over the
      avatar.
      2. We should also be able to see who all have visited the page in the past and the
      last timestamp they visited the page
      5. Show error page when an unauthenticated user is trying to access the page

## Design and architecture

###  Architecture
Frontend Frameworks: React, Redux, Bootstrap

Backend: Google firebase, Google Authentication

### Workflow
Register user with registration page, give login to editors only. 

Once logged in, redirect user to Main page.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
